Console App Documentation
This Console App is developed using C# .NET Framework. It performs the following steps to process user input and display the results:

Step 1: User Input and Concatenation
The app prompts the user to enter the first argument.
The user provides the input for the first argument.
Next, the app prompts the user to enter the second argument.
The user provides the input for the second argument.
Once both arguments are obtained, the app uses an extension method to concatenate the two arguments together and displays the result.

Step 2: Storing Arguments in the Database
The app stores the first and second arguments separately in dedicated columns within the database. This allows for easy retrieval and management of the data.

Step 3: Retrieving and Displaying Arguments
After storing the arguments in the database, the app offers the option to retrieve the list of arguments.
Upon selecting this option, the app fetches the list of arguments from the database.
Finally, the retrieved arguments are displayed on the console for the user to view.
